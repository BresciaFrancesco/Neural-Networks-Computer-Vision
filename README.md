# Attention U-Net for Semantic Image Segmentation on Cityscapes

This project implements a semantic segmentation pipeline using an **Attention U-Net** architecture trained on the **Cityscapes dataset**, optimized with **Focal Loss** to handle class imbalance. The goal is to accurately segment urban street scenes by predicting a class label for each pixel in high-resolution images.

---

## Overview

- **Architecture:** Attention-based U-Net for enhanced skip-connection modulation
- **Loss Function:** Focal Loss
- **Dataset:** Cityscapes â€“ fine-labeled pixel annotations of urban street scenes
- **Evaluation Metric:** Jaccard Index (IoU) per class
- **Logging:** Integrated with [Weights & Biases (wandb)](https://wandb.ai) for experiment tracking
- **Inference & Visualization:** Real-time comparison between baseline and improved models with color-coded masks
